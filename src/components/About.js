                    <h3>My second passion : music</h3>
                    <p>I started learning the guitar a few years ago. In 2021 I decided to challenge myself to learn one new song every day and record myself in the process.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I managed to learn 365+ songs during this year, and thanks to this amazing experience I have learned how much rigor and dedication are important in order to learn anything and become good at it.</p>
                    <p>In 2022 I started to produce my own music with Ableton, and it became obvious to bring together my two passions. Now I'm really happy to be able to create music identities for my web projects.
